# Decimal-Binary-Easy-Version

You are tasked with writing a Solidity contract that takes any unsigned integer (ranging from 0 to 255) as input, converts it to an 8-bit binary representation, and returns the binary representation as a string.

Example : Binary representation of 5 : “101”, 8 bit representation : “00000101”.

The contract should have the following features:
 

Input:
toBinary(uint n) returns (string): This function takes unsigned integer as input and converts the input number to its 8-bit binary representation, and return the binary representation as a string.
